    "### Can an algorithm save the USPTO money by more accurately classifying a patent application than the human contractor that the USPTO pays? (target US classification and IPC classification and assign it to the right art unit)\n",
    "\n",
    "Years ago the classification of newly filed US patent applications was done by USPTO employees.  But at some point a decision got made within the USPTO to outsource the classification process for new patent applications.  Since then, the classification has been carried out by a government contractor.   The contractor often misclassifies cases — in our recent experience this happens about 10% of the time.  When it happens, the case has to be transferred from one art unit to another.  Normally this only delays things by a week or two.  I am not sure what exactly went wrong with all seven of SPE V’s efforts to kick the case.  But as of today he has not managed to get rid of the case despite four months of trying.
